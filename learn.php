		<div class="well align-center">1. &radic;2 * &radic;3 = &radic;(2 * 3) = &radic;6 -- and 6 has no square factors, so this is all you can do.<br>
<br>
2. &radic;2 * &radic;10 = &radic;(2 * 10) = &radic;20 <br>
BUT &radic;20 also equals &radic;( 4 * 5) <br>
and &radic;4 can be taken to get 2, putting this out in front, but leaving the 5 under the surd, to get the simplified answer of 2&radic;5 <br>
<br>
The rule here is: <br>
Numbers outside are different than numbers under a surd, and must be operated on seperately. <br>
<br>
For example: You can add or subtract only if the surds are alike, as in 2&radic;5 + 4&radic;5 = 6&radic;5 <br>
or 10&radic;6 - 3&radic;6 = 7&radic;6 <br>
<br>
When multiplying, you multiply numbers outside seperately from numbers under the surds: <br>
<br>
2&radic;6 * 4&radic;5 = 8&radic;30 since 2* 4 = 8 (outside) and &radic;6 * &radic;5 = &radic;30 (inside) <br>
<br>
BUT, you also need to look for perfect square factors under surds, so you can further simplify: <br>
<br>
3&radic;2 * 7&radic;8 = 21 (3 * 7 outside) * &radic;16 (2 * 8 inside) = 21&radic;16 -- BUT &radic;16 = 4, so the answer actually is, in simplest form, 21 * 4 = 84. <br>
<br>
Then, sometimes you can root out a perfect square from under the surd, and leave something under it: <br>
<br>
5&radic;6 * 3&radic;12 = 15 ( 5 * 3 outside) * &radic;72 (6 * 12 inside). But &radic;72 = &radic;(36 * 2). And &radic;36 = 6 -- so this goes with the outside numbers to get 15 * 6 = 90 outside. The &radic;2 stays as a surd for your answer in simplest form of : 90&radic;2
